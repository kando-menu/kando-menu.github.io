Whenever a new version of Kando is released, several steps need to be performed.
This document describes these steps in detail.
This is mostly for the maintainers of Kando, so that we do not forget anything, but maybe it will be interesting for you as well.

## Updating the Main Repository

<Steps>
0. Check for any pending translation updates [on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/kando/core/#repository) and merge them if necessary.
1. Bump the version number in [`package.json`](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/blob/main/package.json).
2. Run `npm install` to update the lock file.
3. Commit the changes to the two files with a message like `:tada: Bump version number` to the `main` branch.
4. Set the release date and the version name in [`changelog.md`](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/blob/main/docs/changelog.md).
5. Add the new release also to the [`menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml`](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/blob/main/appstream/menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml) file.
6. Commit the changes to the changelog and the appstream file with a message like `:tada: Set release date`.
7. Run the following:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the new version number.
8. This will automatically release all the assets as a pre-release via GitHub actions. Make sure everything is good and then add some text to the new release and publish it!
</Steps>

## Updating the Website

Not much needs to be done for the website. Maybe some <Badge text="soon!" variant="tip" /> badges can be replaced with <Badge text="new!" variant="tip" /> badges.
Also, if there is a new video, it can be linked on the landing page.

## Updating the Flatpak package

Kando's flatpak manifest is maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/flathub/menu.kando.Kando).
To update this to a new version, the following steps need to be performed:
<Steps>
1. Download the new AppImages and get their sha256s:
   ```bash
    wget https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/Kando-X.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage
    wget https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/Kando-X.Y.Z-aarch64.AppImage
    sha256sum Kando-X.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage
    sha256sum Kando-X.Y.Z-aarch64.AppImage
    ```
2. Edit [`menu.kando.Kando.yml`](https://github.com/flathub/menu.kando.Kando/blob/master/menu.kando.Kando.yml) to include the new links to the AppImages and the new sha256s.
3. `menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml` needs to be updated as well as it now contains the new release date and the new version number. Go [here](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/blob/main/appstream/menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml) and press <kbd>y</kbd> to change the URL to the commit hash variant. Copy the hash.
4. Run this:
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kando-menu/kando/<hash>/appstream/menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml
    sha256sum menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml
    ```
5. Edit the `menu.kando.Kando.yml` file again and replace the commit hash and the sha256 for the `menu.kando.Kando.metainfo.xml` accordingly.
4. If `menu.kando.Kando.svg` or `menu.kando.Kando.desktop` had been changed since the last release, you need to update them as well. You can do this in the same manner as above.
5. Commit the changes to the `menu.kando.Kando.yml` file to a new branch and create a pull request.
</Steps>


## Updating the winget package

Kando is also available on Windows via the [winget package manager](https://winstall.app/apps/KandoMenu.Kando).
To publish a new version there, the following steps need to be performed:

<Steps>
1. Update our fork of the [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/kando-menu/winget-pkgs) repository.
2. Manually dispatch the [deploy workflow](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/actions/workflows/deploy_to_winget.yml).
</Steps>
