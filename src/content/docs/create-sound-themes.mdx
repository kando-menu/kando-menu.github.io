<Intro>
Kando allows you to create custom sound themes to make the menu even more fun to use.
A sound theme is a collection of sound files which are played when certain events occur in the menu.
</Intro>

<Aside type="tip" title="Need Help?">
If you encounter a problem at any stage, feel free to ask for help in the **#support** or **#dev-chat** channel on [Kando's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy)!

## <Icon name="solar:folder-favourite-star-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Sound Theme Locations

If you want to create a new sound theme, you should put **a new subdirectory** into the `sound-themes` directory.
The location of this directory depends on your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```
    %appdata%\kando\sound-themes\
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/kando/sound-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```
    ~/.config/kando/sound-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
    ```
    ~/.var/app/menu.kando.Kando/config/kando/sound-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="danger">
Kando will also load menu themes from `resources/app/.webpack/renderer/assets/sound-themes/` in the installation directory. You should not put your themes there, as they might be overwritten during an update.
</Aside>

If you are running Kando from the source code via `npm start`, it will also look for themes in the `assets/sound-themes/` directory.


## <Icon name="solar:dna-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Anatomy of a Sound Theme

This section will give you an overview of the files you need to create a new sound theme.
A sound theme directory must contain a `theme.json5` file and can contain any number of sound files.

<FileTree>
- kando
  - sound-themes
    - my-theme
      - theme.json5
      - REUSE.toml
      - foo.mp3 You can put any number of sound files in your theme directory and name them whatever you like.
</FileTree>

`theme.json5` contains metadata about the theme and assigns sound files to certain events.

`REUSE.toml` is not strictly necessary, but it is recommended to include it in your theme directory. It contains information about the license of your theme.

Besides, you can put any sound files you like in your theme directory.
Kando supports mp3, mpeg, opus, ogg, oga, wav, aac, caf, m4a, mp4, weba, webm, dolby, and flac files.

## <Icon name="solar:layers-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> The `theme.json5` File

Below you can have a look at a simple `theme.json5` file.
Besides the metadata, it contains a list of sound files which are played when certain events occur in the menu.

<Aside type="tip">
You can also name this file `theme.json`. But [JSON5](https://json5.org/) is a bit easier to read and allows for comments.

      volume: 0.5,

      file: "hover.mp3",

      maxPitch: 1.1,
    },
  },
}
```

### Available Sound Events

The following events are available for sound themes.
For each event, you can specify a sound file which is played when the event occurs.
It is perfectly fine to reuse the same sound file for multiple events.

<div style="width:120px">Event</div>  | Description
--- | ---
`openMenu` | This event is triggered when a menu is opened.
`closeMenu` | This event is triggered when a menu is closed without selecting an item.
`hoverItem` | This event is triggered when a leaf item is hovered with the mouse. That is an item which does not have any children and can be executed.
`hoverParent` | This event is triggered when the parent of the current center item is hovered with the mouse.
`hoverSubmenu` | This event is triggered when a submenu which could be opened is hovered with the mouse.
`selectItem` | This event is triggered when an action is executed by selecting an item.
`selectParent` | This event is triggered when the user navigates to the parent of the current center item.
`selectSubmenu` | This event is triggered when a submenu is opened.

### Advanced Configuration

For each event, you can specify the volume of the sound file and the pitch of the sound file.
This allows reusing the same sound file for multiple events while making them sound different.
If you specify a `minPitch` and a `maxPitch`, Kando will play the sound file with a random pitch between these two values.
You can set them to the same value to play the sound file with a fixed pitch.

```json5 title="theme.json5" {4-6}
// ...
hoverItem: {
  file: "hover.mp3",
  volume: 0.5,
  minPitch: 0.9,
  maxPitch: 1.1,
},
// ...
```

## <Icon name="solar:copyright-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Adding Proper Credits

A theme usually builds upon the work of others.
Therefore, it is important to give proper credit to the original authors!

To make sure that your theme is compliant with the licenses of the assets, it is highly recommended to follow the corresponding steps outlined in the [menu-theme creation guide](/create-menu-themes#-adding-proper-credits).

## <Icon name="solar:cloud-upload-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Distributing your Theme

You are invited to show your themes in [Kando's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy)!
You can also contribute your themes to the [Kando Sound Themes Repository](https://github.com/kando-menu/sound-themes) by creating a pull request.

You are awesome!
Creating sound themes for Kando is a great way to contribute to the project and to make the menu even more fun to use for everyone.
