<Intro>
If you want to contribute by fixing a 🐛 **nasty bug** or implementing an 🎉 **awesome new feature**, you are very welcome to do so!
</Intro>

We are happy to receive contributions in the form of **pull requests** on GitHub.
Feel free to fork the repository, implement your changes and create a merge request to the `main` branch!

<CustomAside type="note" title="Not Sure Where to Start?">
There are always some issues labelled as [good first issue](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Feel free to pick one of these and ask for some pointers for how to get started in the comments!
</CustomAside>

## 1. Fork the Kando Repository

As you do not have write access to the main repository, you need to fork it first.
For this, click the button below:

<LinkButton

>
  Fork Kando on GitHub!
</LinkButton>

Kando uses a simplified version of [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/):
New features are usually implemented in `feature/*` branches and are merged to `main` once they are finished.
Similarly, bugfixes are implemented in `fix/*` branches, where the `*` is usually the issue number (e.g. `fix/#123`).

While it does not matter how you name the branches in your fork, it is a good idea to follow this convention to organize your work.

<CustomAside type="tip" title="Need Help?">
If you encounter a problem at any stage, feel free to ask for help in the comments of the corresponding issue or join the development chat on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy)!

## 2. Write Some Code

Kando uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
You can either configure your editor to format the code on save or run `npm run format` before committing your changes.

Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in imperative mood (e.g. **:tada: Add cool new feature** instead of **:tada: Added cool new feature**).
It's a great idea to start the commit message with an applicable emoji.
This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit:
Commits should be small and focused on a single task.
Therefore, only one emoji should be used per commit.

- 🎉 `:tada:` when adding a cool new feature.
- 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug.
- 🔧 `:wrench:` when adding small piece of code.
- 🚀 `:rocket:` when improving performance.
- ♻️ `:recycle:` when refactoring the code.
- 🔥 `:fire:` when removing files or code.
- 🚚 `:truck:` when moving / renaming files or classes.
- ✨ `:sparkles:` when formatting the code.
- 🎨 `:art:` improving or adding assets like themes or fonts.
- 💄 `:lipstick:` when working on the UI styling.
- 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs.
- 🌐 `:globe_with_meridians:` when working on localization.
- 💞 `:revolving_hearts:` when updating credits.
- ✔️ `:heavy_check_mark:` when working on tests.
- 🔼 `:arrow_up_small:` when adding / upgrading dependencies.
- 🔽 `:arrow_down_small:` when removing / downgrading dependencies.
- 🔀 `:twisted_rightwards_arrows:` when merging branches.

**Usage of these emojis is not mandatory.**
We will still accept your pull request if you don't use them.
However, we will be very happy if you do :smile:.

<CustomAside type="note" title="Keep a Changelog!">
Kando uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and the [changelog](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/blob/main/docs/changelog.md) follows the rules of [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).
Whenever you add a new feature or fix a bug, please add an entry to the top of the changelog in the `[unreleased]` section.
When a new version is released, this section will be marked as released and a tag is created on the `main` branch.
</CustomAside>

## 3. Finally: Create a Pull Request

Finally, when you are finished with your changes, push them to your fork and create a pull request to the `main` branch of Kando's repository.

Several checks will be performed automatically.
Kando uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/actions) for continuous integration.

- For **each commit**, several checks are performed. These include code formatting, linting, [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) compliance and unit tests.
- For **pull requests**, it is checked in addition that the application can be packaged for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

<CustomAside type="thanks" title="Time to Celebrate!">
Thank you very much for your contribution! You are awesome! 💞
