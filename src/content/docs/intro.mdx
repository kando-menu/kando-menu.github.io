<Intro>
Kando offers an unconventional, fast, highly efficient, and fun way of interacting with your computer!
You can use it to launch applications, simulate keyboard shortcuts, open files, and much more.

## What makes Kando so efficient?

Kando uses [Fitts's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law) to make selections as fast as possible.
In additions, Kando is a [_marking menu_](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/the-design-and-evaluation.pdf_recHpUp1v9dc1n2CJ.pdf) which allows you to select items by drawing zig-zag lines.

<summary>What is Fitts's Law?</summary>

Fitts's Law tells us that the time required to move to a target primarily depends on the distance to the target and the size of the target in direction of the movement.
**A pie menu minimizes the distance to the target and maximizes the size of the target!**
You do not have to aim at the items you want to select, but you can click anywhere in the wedge of an item!

This is extremely powerful!
**You can select things in subsubsubmenus in well below a second without looking at your screen!**
You can watch the video below to get an idea on how Kando works.

<center><sup>Beware, there's some cringy music inside üòÖ</sup></center>

Kando is designed to be used with üñ±Ô∏è mouse, üñäÔ∏è stylus, üëÜ touch, or üéÆ controller input.
If you have both hands at your keyboard most of the time, Kando is maybe not the right tool for you.
