Sometimes it is useful to run Kando from the command line in order to see the output of the application.
If you installed Kando via a package manager or via one of the installers from GitHub, Kando's executable will be located in one of the following directories:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    On Windows, the path to the executable depends on the current version number. Just copy `%localappdata%\Kando` into the address bar of the Windows Explorer and check the contained directories.
    ```cmd
    %localappdata%\Kando\app-<version number>\Kando.exe
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    On macOS, the executable is located in the following directory:
    ```bash
    /Applications/Kando.app/Contents/MacOS/Kando
    ```
    <Aside type="caution" title="Grant Permissions!">
    If you run Kando from the command line, you need to grant the required permissions _to the terminal_. See [Installing on macOS](/installation-on-macos#required-permissions) to learn which permissions are required.

    On Linux, this depends on the installation method. The executable is usually located in one of the following directories:
    ```bash
    /usr/bin/kando
    /usr/local/bin/kando
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
    ```bash
    flatpak run menu.kando.Kando
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
