<Intro>
On Windows, you can either install Kando via `winget`, via an installer, or by downloading a ZIP archive.
You can follow the steps below or watch the video above to get started!
</Intro>


## <Icon name="seti:windows" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via `winget`

Using `winget` is maybe the easiest way to install Kando on Windows.
It's not shown in the video above as it was released for `winget` after the video was created.

<Steps>

1. Type <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the "Run" dialog. Type `cmd` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open a command prompt.

2. Type the following command to install Kando:
    ```bash
    winget install kando
    ```
    :::note
    Windows may show a warning because the executable is not signed. Just click on "More info" and then on "Run anyway".
    :::

3. After the installation, you will find Kando in your start menu. Just click on the Kando icon to start the application. Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.

4. You can now start using Kando! Just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the example menu!

</Steps>


## <AstroIcon name="solar:cloud-download-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via the Installer

The installer will install Kando on your system and add it to your start menu.
Just head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/releases) and download the latest installer. It's the file which ends in `*.Setup.exe` file.

<Steps>

1. Double-click the downloaded file to start the installation process. Not much will happen, as the installation process is very minimal and does not require any user interaction.

## <AstroIcon name="solar:zip-file-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via the ZIP Archive

The zip archive is the standalone version of Kando. You can also download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/releases). It's the file which starts with `Kando-win32-x64-*` and ends in `.zip`.

<Steps>

1. Extract the archive to any directory you like.

2. Run the `kando.exe` executable from the extracted directory. Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.
