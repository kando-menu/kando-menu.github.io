## <Icon name="solar:check-circle-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Supported Desktop Environments

Implementing a menu like Kando for various desktop environments is not exactly easy.
Things like getting the mouse position before opening a window, simulating key presses, or getting the name of the currently focused application window may have to be implemented differently.

## <Icon name="solar:box-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via a Package Manager

<Steps>

1. Kando is already available in several package managers. 
   <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Flathub">
      Kando is [available on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/menu.kando.Kando).
      ```bash
      flatpak install flathub menu.kando.Kando
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="AUR">
      You can install [`kando-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kando-bin/) from the AUR.
      ```bash
      yay -S kando-bin
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="NixOS">
      A [`kando`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=24.11&show=kando) package is available in Nixpkgs.
      ```bash
      nix-shell -p kando
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="AM or AppMan">
      You can install Kando from the [AppMan](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps) package manager.
      ```bash
      am -i kando
      ```
    </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. After the installation, you can start Kando from your application launcher! Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.

3. On most X11 based distributions, you can now press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the example menu!
   <Aside type="note" title='This does not work?'>
    On some desktop environments, especially those based on Wayland, you will have to perform some additional steps. Read more in the [Desktop Specifics](#desktop-specifics) section below for more information.
   </Aside>

</Steps>

## <Icon name="solar:zip-file-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via a Pre-Packaged Binary

<Steps>

1. Just head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/releases) and download a package that fits your distribution.
   <Tabs syncKey="download-type">
    <TabItem label="Ubuntu">
      On Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions, you can download the `Kando_*_amd64.deb` package.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Fedora">
      On Fedora and other RPM-based distributions, you can download the `Kando-*.x86_64.rpm` package.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="AppImage">
      The `Kando-*-x86_64.AppImage` package is a universal package that should work on most distributions.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Zip Archive">
      The `Kando-linux-x64-*.zip` package is a generic package that should work on most distributions.
    </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Install the package. The AppImage and Zip Archive packages are standalone and can be run directly. The other packages need to be installed.
   <Tabs syncKey="download-type">
    <TabItem label="Ubuntu">
      ```bash
      sudo dpkg -i Kando_*_amd64.deb
      ```
      After the installation, you can start Kando from your application launcher! Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Fedora">
      ```bash
      sudo rpm -i Kando-*.x86_64.rpm
      ```
      After the installation, you can start Kando from your application launcher! Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="AppImage">
      ```bash
      chmod +x Kando-*-x86_64.AppImage
      ./Kando-*-x86_64.AppImage
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Zip Archive">
      ```bash
      unzip Kando-linux-x64-*.zip
      ./Kando-linux-x64/kando
      ```
    </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. On most X11 based distributions, you can now press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the example menu!
   <Aside type="note" title='This does not work?'>
    On some desktop environments, especially those based on Wayland, you will have to perform some additional steps. Read more in the [Desktop Specifics](#desktop-specifics) section below for more information.
   </Aside>
  
</Steps>

## Desktop Specifics

Implementing a menu like Kando on Wayland is not exactly easy.
Things like getting the mouse position before opening a window, simulating key presses, or getting the name of the currently focused application window does not work out of the box.
Therefore, Kando needs some additional setup on Wayland based desktop environments.
There are also some X11 based desktop environments that need some additional setup.

### <Icon name="simple-icons:gnome" class="inline-icon" /> GNOME on Wayland

You will also need to install the [üêö Kando Integration Extension](https://github.com/kando-menu/gnome-shell-integration).
Via a D-Bus interface, it provides the name of the currently focused window, and the current mouse pointer position.
Furthermore, it allows registering and simulating keyboard shortcuts.


### <Icon name="simple-icons:kde" class="inline-icon" /> KDE Plasma on Wayland

If you are using Plasma on Wayland, Kando cannot directly bind global shortcuts.
Instead, you specify a shortcut ID for each menu in Kando's menu editor and bind a key combination for this shortcut ID in your system settings.
You can bind a shortcut to the shortcut ID under the KWin section in the global shortcuts settings.

### <Icon name="simple-icons:hyprland" class="inline-icon" /> Hyprland

You will need some window rules for Kando.
Else, the menu will not float above other windows.

```
// ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
windowrule = noblur, kando
windowrule = opaque, kando
windowrule = size 100% 100%, kando
windowrule = noborder, kando
windowrule = noanim, kando
windowrule = float, kando
windowrule = pin, kando
```

Also, Kando cannot directly bind global shortcuts on Hyprland.
Instead, you specify a shortcut ID for each menu in Kando's menu editor and bind a key combination in `hyprland.conf`.
Replace `example-menu` with the ID of your menu.

```
// ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
bind = CTRL, Space, global, kando:example-menu
```

Furthermore
1. Toggling Special-Workspace through kando-menu will be glitchy (i.e in some cases special-workspace will reopen instead of closing). See https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/issues/784
2. After triggering kando-menu-item of type `Run command` whose target is `activewindow` will not work correctly as by default Hyprland restores focus_on_close to next candidate window. See https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/issues/812

Both of above can be solved by using the following config
```
// ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
input {
    special_fallthrough = true # having only floating windows in the special workspace will not block focusing windows in the regular workspace.
    focus_on_close = 1 # focus will shift to the window under the cursor.
}
```

### Dusk

On Dusk, you will have to install and use a compositor like `picom` or `compton` to make the transparency work.
Also, you will need some window rules for Kando:
```cpp
// dusk/config.def.h
static const Rule clientrules[] = {
  { .class = "kando", .flags = FullScreen }, //kando should be on top of DOCK clientrule
  { .wintype = WTYPE "DESKTOP", .flags = Unmanaged|Lower },
  { .wintype = WTYPE "DOCK", .flags = Unmanaged|Raise },
};
```

### LXDE, i3, Openbox, and others

On some minimal desktop environments, you will have to install and use a compositor like `picom` or `compton` to make the transparency work.
