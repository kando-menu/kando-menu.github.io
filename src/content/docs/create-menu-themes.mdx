<Intro>
Kando allows you to create custom themes for the menus.
A theme defines several layers which will be painted on top of each other for each menu item.
Depending on the menu item's state (e.g. active, child, parent, hovered, etc.), the layers can be styled differently using [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).
</Intro>

<Aside type="tip" title="Need Help?">
If you encounter a problem at any stage, feel free to ask for help in the **#support** or **#menu-themes** channel on [Kando's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy)!
</Aside>

## <Icon name="solar:folder-favourite-star-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Menu Theme Locations

If you want to create a new menu theme, you should put **a new subdirectory** into the `menu-themes` directory.
The location of this directory depends on your operating system:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```
    %appdata%\kando\menu-themes\
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/kando/menu-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```
    ~/.config/kando/menu-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
    ```
    ~/.var/app/menu.kando.Kando/config/kando/menu-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="danger">
Kando will also load menu themes from `resources/app/.webpack/renderer/assets/menu-themes/` in the installation directory. This is were the default themes are stored. You should not put your themes there, as they might be overwritten during an update.
</Aside>

If you are running Kando from the source code via `npm start`, it will also look for themes in the `assets/menu-themes/` directory.


## <Icon name="solar:dna-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Anatomy of a Menu Theme

This section will give you an overview of the files you need to create a new menu theme.
Thereafter we will have a look at the individual parts in more detail.
<Aside type="note" title="Required Files">
A menu theme directory must contain at least three files: `theme.json5`, `theme.css`, and `preview.jpg`.
</Aside>
<FileTree>
- kando
  - menu-themes
    - my-theme
      - theme.json5
      - theme.css
      - preview.jpg
      - REUSE.toml
      - assets/ You can put any fonts or images your theme uses into a subdirectory.
</FileTree>

`theme.json5` contains metadata about the theme and a list of layers which will be created for each menu item.
Each layer gets a specific _class name_ which can be used in the CSS file to style the layer.

`theme.css` can contain any CSS code you like. With _CSS selectors_, you can choose which layers to style in which way.
The CSS file can reference assets like images or fonts. These can be placed in the same directory as the JSON and CSS files or in a subdirectory.

`preview.jpg` is a square-shaped image which will be shown in the menu editor to preview the theme.

`REUSE.toml` is not strictly necessary, but it is recommended to include it in your theme directory. It contains information about the license of your theme.

## <Icon name="solar:layers-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Metadata and Layer Description

Below you can have a look at the `theme.json5` file of the default theme.
The keys are explained with inline comments.
Most of it will be clear, but some keys might need a bit more explanation.
We will have a look at the `colors` and `layers` keys in the following sections.

<Aside type="tip">
You can also name this file `theme.json`. But [JSON5](https://json5.org/) is a bit easier to read and allows for comments.
</Aside>

  // These colors can be configured by the user and are vailable in

  // user does not provide any values.
  colors: {
    'background-color': 'rgb(255, 255, 255)',
    'text-color': 'rgb(60, 60, 60)',
    'border-color': 'rgb(109, 109, 109)',
    'hover-color': 'rgb(255, 200, 200)',
  },

  // This theme is very simple and only uses one layer for the menu items.
  layers: [{ class: 'icon-layer', content: 'icon' }],
}
```

### `colors: {}`

The `colors` object lists colors which can be configured by the user in the menu editor.
Each entry maps a CSS color to a given color name.
In your CSS file, you can use the colors with `var(--<key>)`.
In the menu editor, the user can change the value of these colors.

### `layers: []`

This is maybe the most important part of the metadata file.
It describes the div elements which will be created for each menu item.
The layer will be **drawn top-to-bottom** in the order they are defined in the JSON file.
So the first layer will be the topmost layer, and the last layer will be the bottommost layer.

Each layer has a `class` and a `content` key.
The `class` key is used in the CSS file to style the corresponding div element.
The value for the `content` key is a string.
For now, these content strings are limited to the following values:

Content&nbsp;Type | Description
--- | ---
`"none"` | The layer will not contain any additional content. This is for instance useful for simple background layers. You can also assign a background-image to the layer in the CSS file.
`"icon"` | The layer will contain a nested `.icon-container` element for this menu item. For a simple theme, a single layer of this type is usually enough, as you can style the layer to have a background color, border, drop shadow, etc.
`"name"` | The text content of the layer element will be the name of the menu item.

<Aside type="tip">
You can use the **same content type multiple times** in the `layers` array.
For instance, it is perfectly fine to have multiple layers with `content: "icon"`.
This could be useful if you want to add a glow effect to the icon: There's one layer with the icon and another layer below with a blurred version of the icon.
</Aside>

However, keep in mind that the menu rendering performance will generally be better if you use fewer layers.


## <Icon name="solar:pallete-2-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Styling of the Layers

The `theme.css` file is where you define how the layers are styled.
Using CSS selectors, you can style the layers differently depending on the menu item's state.
Each menu item has the class `.menu-node` and will have child elements for each layer you defined in the JSON file.

So for instance the following will style the `.icon-layer` of the currently active menu item:

```css title="theme.css"
.menu-node.active>.icon-layer {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

### CSS Classes of the Menu Items

Kando assigns a lot of CSS classes to each menu-item element based on the current state of the menu item (child, center, parent, hovered, etc).
This allows you to style the menu items differently depending on their state.
The overall tree structure of the menu may look like this:

```
#kando-menu
├ .menu-node.level-0.top.type-submenu.parent                    <-- This is the root item of the menu.
│  ├ .menu-node.level-1.top.type-submenu.grandchild                 It has three children, the third one
│  │  ├ .menu-node.level-2.right.type-uri                           is a submenu which is currently open.
│  │  └ .menu-node.level-2.left.type-command
│  ├ .menu-node.level-1.right.type-submenu.grandchild
│  │  ├ .menu-node.level-2.top.type-hotkey
│  │  └ .menu-node.level-2.bottom.type-macro
│  └ .menu-node.level-1.left.type-submenu.active                <-- This is the currently active menu item.
│     ├ .menu-node.level-2.child.top.type-uri                       It has four children.
│     ├ .menu-node.level-2.type-submenu.child.hovered.dragged   <-- The second child is a submenu which is
│     │  ├ .menu-node.level-3.grandchild.top.type-command           currently dragged around in marking or
│     │  └ .menu-node.level-3.grandchild.bottom.type-command        turbo mode.
│     ├ .menu-node.level-2.child.left.type-submenu
│     │  ├ .menu-node.level-3.grandchild.top.type-command
│     │  └ .menu-node.level-3.grandchild.bottom.type-command
│     └ .menu-node.level-2.child.right.type-macro
└ .center-text                                                  <-- This is the text shown in the center
                                                                    of the menu.
```

In this example, the menu container contains two elements: The center text and the root item of the menu.
The center text shows the name of the currently selected item.
It is automatically moved to the currently active menu item.
In the above case, the root item contains three submenus.
The third child is a submenu which is currently open (`.active`).
Therefore the root item is a `.parent` and the other two children are drawn as `.grandchild`.
The `.active` child has four children itself, two of which have grandchildren.
The second child is currently `.dragged` in marking mode.
It also is `.hovered` by the mouse cursor.

In addition, each menu node has a **class for the current level** (`.level-0`, `.level-1`, `.level-2`, etc).
This can be used to style the menu items differently depending on their depth in the menu tree.
Only the root item has the class `.level-0`.

Furthermore, the **menu node classes contain the type of the item** (`.type-submenu`, `.type-uri`, `.type-command`, etc).
This can be used to style different item types differently.

Last but not least, **each menu node has a class for its approximate direction** relative to the center of the menu (`.top`, `.right`, `.bottom`, `.left`). Escept for the root node, which is always in the center.

Not depicted in the tree structure above are **the connector lines** between the menu items and the layers added by the theme.
The connector lines are long divs which are appended to each submenu menu node.
They have the class `.connector` and can be styled as well.

<Aside type="note">
In the "Development" tab of the sidebar, you can find a button to open the inspector. You can use them to explore the structure of the menu and find out how the layers are created.
</Aside>

### CSS Properties of the Menu Items

In addition to the colors specified in the theme's JSON file, Kando sets some custom CSS properties on some `.menu-node` and layer div elements.

#### Menu Node Properties

The following properties are available on some `.menu-node` elements.
See the details for each property to find out on which elements they are available.

<details>
<summary>`--dir-x` and `--dir-y`</summary>
_Available on all elements with the `.menu-node` class except for the root node._

The normalized x and y direction of the menu item relative to the parent menu item.
If the item is on the right side, the x-direction will be `1`, if it's on the left, it will be `-1`.
The same applies to the y-direction, but with the top being `-1` and the bottom being `1`.
This is usually used to position the item correctly around the parent.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--angle`</summary>
_Available on all elements with the `.menu-node` class except for the root node._

The angle of the item in degrees, starting at the top with 0° and going clockwise.
This is useful if you want to rotate a layer with respect to the item's position.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--siblings-count`</summary>
_Available on all elements with the `.menu-node` class except for the root node._

The number of child items the item's parent has. This can be used to increase the child item distance if there are many children.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--parent-angle`</summary>
_Available on all elements with the `.menu-node` class except for the root node and the direct children of the root node._

The angle of the parent item relative to its parent in degrees, starting at the top with 0° and going clockwise. This is useful for styling grandchildren as this will be the same as the `--angle` property of the child.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--angle-diff`</summary>
_Available on all elements with the `.menu-node.child` classes. That is, all children of the currently active menu item._

The angular difference between the item and the direction towards the mouse pointer.
This is useful if you want to create some kind of fisheye effect when the mouse pointer is close to the item.
</details>

#### Center Layer Properties

These properties are available on all your layer divs attached to the current center menu item.
That is, all layers attached to the menu node with the `.menu-node.active` classes.

<details>
<summary>`--pointer-angle`</summary>
The angle towards the mouse pointer in degrees, starting at the top with 0° and going clockwise.
You can use this to rotate a layer towards the mouse pointer.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--hover-angle`</summary>
The angle towards the currently hovered item in degrees, starting at the top with 0° and going clockwise.
If the center is hovered, this will be the direction towards the parent item (if there is any).
You can use this to rotate a layer towards the hovered item.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--hovered-child-angle`</summary>
The same as `--hover-angle`, but if the center is hovered, this will not be updated.
</details>




### Styling the Layers

You can now use [CSS selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp) to style each of these elements.
Usually, you will want to apply a transformation to the `.menu-node` elements to position them correctly on their position around the center.
Appearance properties like `background-color`, `border`, `box-shadow`, or `filter` are usually applied to the layer elements.
Here's how the `theme.css` file of the default theme looks like:

```css title="theme.css"

  &.active:has(.hovered)>.child {
    transform: scale(calc(1.15 - pow(var(--angle-diff) / 180, 0.25) * 0.15)) translate(calc(max(var(--child-distance), 10px * var(--sibling-count)) * var(--dir-x)),
        calc(max(var(--child-distance), 10px * var(--sibling-count)) * var(--dir-y)));

    &.hovered {
      transform: scale(1.15) translate(calc(max(var(--child-distance), 10px * var(--sibling-count)) * var(--dir-x)),

You should have a look at this default theme to get an idea of how to style the menu.
It is maybe a good idea to start with a copy of the default theme and modify it to your needs.
You can also have a look at the [other included themes](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/tree/main/assets/menu-themes) for inspiration, most of them use more than one layer.

Another good theme to get started with is the very simple [Minecraft Theme](https://github.com/kando-menu/menu-themes/tree/main/themes/minecraft) available in the Kando Menu Themes Repository.

<Aside type="tip">
In the "Development" tab of the sidebar, you can find a "Reload Menu Theme" button. You can use this button during theme development to reload the theme without restarting Kando. Changes you made to the CSS file will be applied immediately, for changes to the JSON file you need to re-open the menu. If you are running Kando from the source code via `npm start`, any changes made to the themes in the `assets/menu-themes/` directory will be applied immediately.
</Aside>

### Useful CSS Selectors

Here are some CSS selectors which you may find useful.
Feel free to add more selectors to this list if you find something useful!

```css
/* The center item if it has a hovered child. */
.menu-node.active:has(>.hovered) {}

/* A child of the center item if it or any of its siblings are hovered. */
.menu-node.active:has(.hovered)>.child {}

/* Menu nodes with a specific name. */
.menu-node[data-name='Menu Item Name'] {}
```

## <Icon name="solar:gallery-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> A Preview for your Theme

`preview.jpg` should be a **square** screenshot of a menu with the theme applied.
You can use a custom background to suit your theme.
The menu should be shown in the center of the image, the default themes use a resolution of **700x700 pixels**, but Kando will scale the image to fit the preview area in the menu editor.

## <Icon name="solar:copyright-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Adding Proper Credits

A theme usually builds upon the work of others.
Therefore, it is important to give proper credit to the original authors!
All the assets you use in your theme may be subject to copyright and may be licensed under different terms.

If you choose to submit your theme to the [Kando Menu Themes Repository](https://github.com/kando-menu/menu-themes), you should make sure that your theme follows the [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) specification.
As a theme author, it is your responsibility to make sure that there is proper license and copyright information for each file of your theme.
You can follow the existing themes as examples.

### Where should I put the license information?

For text files like `.json` or `.css`, you can simply add an SPDX license header at the top of the file. This can look like this:

```css
/* SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Your Name <email@server.com> */
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0 */
```

For binary files like images or fonts, you should create a `REUSE.toml` file in your theme directory.
You can have a look at [this file](https://github.com/kando-menu/menu-themes/blob/main/KnightForge/REUSE.toml) for an example.

### What is a valid SPDX-FileCopyrightText?

- For **files you copied from others**, you should use the original author's copyright text.
- For **files you created yourself**, the copyright text should ideally be your name and email address.
  If you do not want to share this publicly, you can also use a pseudonym.
  It would be great if it was possible to contact you in case there are questions about your theme.
  So maybe using a Discord handle or a GitHub username is a good idea in this case.
- For **files you modified**, you should add your own copyright line above the original one. There can be multiple `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` in each file.

<Aside type="tip">
Some examples of SPDX-FileCopyrightText's are given in [the specification](https://reuse.software/spec-3.3/#format-of-copyright-notices).
</Aside>

### Which SPDX-License-Identifier should I choose?

If you **copied a file from somewhere else**, you usually have to use the same license as the original file.
There exceptions to this rule, but it is usually a good idea to stick to the original license.

If you **created a file yourself**, you can use any license you like.
For artwork like themes, the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) licenses are often a good choice.
Here are some examples:

- If folks should be able to use your file however they like, you can use the `CC0-1.0` license.
- If you want to be credited, you can use the `CC-BY-4.0` license.
- If you want to force others to use the same license for their modifications, you can use the `CC-BY-SA-4.0` license.

<Aside type="tip">
A list of all valid SPDX-License-Identifier can be found [here](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
</Aside>

As a rule of thumb, we would recommend using the `CC0-1.0` license for simple configuration files like your `theme.json5` file and another Creative Commons license like `CC-BY-4.0` for your artwork.
