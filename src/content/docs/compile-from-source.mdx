<Intro>
If you want to test the latest development version of Kando, or want to contribute code, you will have to compile Kando from source.
</Intro>



## <Icon name="solar:link-square-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installing Dependencies

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    You will need Git, NodeJS, CMake, and a C++ toolchain. There are several ways to install these on Windows. Here is a common way to get them:
    <Steps>

      1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/). They have an easy-to-use installer.

      2. Install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). They have an easy-to-use installer. This will install the latest version of NodeJS alongside `npm`, the package manager for NodeJS. 

      3. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). They have an installer for Windows as well.

      4. To get the Microsoft MSVC toolchain, you can install either Visual Studio or run this:
        
         ```bash
         npm install -g windows-build-tools
         ```
    </Steps>

    

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    On macOS, you will need Git, the Xcode Commandline Tools, and CMake.
    To get `node` and `npm`, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
    CMake and Git can easily be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```bash
    brew install cmake git
    ```
    If you have Homebrew installed, you will also have the Xcode Commandline Tools installed.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Debian" icon="linux">
    On Linux, `gcc` and `git` are usually already installed.
    However, some additional packages may be required for the native backend modules.
    You can install them with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nodejs cmake libx11-dev libxtst-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Arch" icon="linux">
    On Linux, `gcc` and `git` are usually already installed.
    However, some additional packages may be required for the native backend modules.
    You can install them with:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S nodejs npm cmake libx11 libxtst wayland libxkbcommon
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fedora" icon="linux">
    On Linux, `gcc` and `git` are usually already installed.
    However, some additional packages may be required for the native backend modules.
    You can install them with:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install nodejs cmake libX11-devel libXtst-devel wayland-devel libxkbcommon-devel
    ```

## <Icon name="solar:download-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Cloning the Repository

First, you will need to clone the Kando repository.
Open a terminal and navigate to a directory where you want the sources of Kando and clone the repository using the commands below.

<Aside type="tip">
If you plan to contribute to Kando, it would be great to [fork the repository](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando/fork) first.
This way, you can create a pull request with your changes later.
If you do this, use the URL of your fork in the `git clone` command below.
</Aside>

```bash
cd "path/to/your/directory"
git clone https://github.com/kando-menu/kando.git
```

## <Icon name="solar:download-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Downloading Required Node Modules

Navigate into the cloned `kando` directory and run the following command.
This only needs to be done once, or when the dependencies change.
It will download all required dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.

```bash
cd kando
npm install
```

## <Icon name="solar:rocket-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Running Kando

Finally, you can start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Once this is running, you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open the example menu.

<Aside type="tip">
On macOS, you will need to grant the [required permissions](/installation-on-macos#required-permissions) to the terminal you are using to start Kando.
</Aside>

If started this way, Kando will run in development mode.
This means that any changes to the source code (at least to the renderer process) will be applied immediately.
So you usually don't have to restart the application after changing the code.


## <Icon name="solar:settings-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Creating a Release Executable

To create an executable compiled in release mode, run the following command.
This will create a directory in the `out/` directory containing the `kando` executable.

```bash
npm run package
```


## <Icon name="solar:box-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Creating a Distributable Package

To create a distributable archive, just run this:

```bash
npm run make
```

This will create several packages in the `out/` directory.
* On Windows, it will create a Squirrel installer and a portable zip archive.
* On Linux, it will create Debian, an RPM and a portable zip archive.
* On macOS, it will create a DMG file and a portable zip archive. If the environment variables `KANDO_OSX_SIGN` and `KANDO_OSX_NOTARIZE` are set to `true`, the build process will try to sign and notarize the application.


## <Icon name="solar:lightbulb-bolt-line-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Common Issues

On some Linux distributions, you may encounter the error `The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now`. This is related to [this issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972) and can be fixed by running these commands:

```bash
sudo chmod 4755 node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
sudo chown root node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
```
