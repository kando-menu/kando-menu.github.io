<Intro>
If you want to üí° **understand Kando's code base** or fix an especially üêõ **nasty bug**, using a debugger is a great idea.
</Intro>

However, debugging an Electron application is not exactly straightforward.
This is because Electron applications consist of two parts: the main process and the renderer processes.

The main process is responsible for managing the application lifecycle and has access to the operating system.
The renderer processes are responsible for rendering the user interface and are more or less isolated from the operating system.
Kando has one main process and two renderer processes: one for the menu and one for the settings dialog.

## Debugging in VSCode

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can set up debugging by creating a `.vscode/launch.json` file in your project directory.
Put the following content into that file:

```json5 title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Kando: Main Process",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/tsx",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "node_modules/@electron-forge/cli/src/electron-forge-start",
        "--",
        "--remote-debugging-port=9223"
      ],
      "autoAttachChildProcesses": true,
      "internalConsoleOptions": "openOnFirstSessionStart",
      "console": "integratedTerminal"
    },
    {
      "name": "Kando: Renderer Processes",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9223,
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "timeout": 100000
    }
  ],
  "compounds": [
    {
      "name": "Kando: All",
      "configurations": ["Kando: Main Process", "Kando: Renderer Processes"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Once this is in place, you can start debugging Kando by selecting the "Kando: All" configuration in the debug panel and clicking the green play button.
This will start the main process and attach the debugger to both the main process and the renderer processes.
You can then set breakpoints in your code and inspect variables!
