<Intro>
Kando can be configured to load and save all its [configuration files](/config-files) in its installation directory.
In fact, you can set any directory as Kando's configuration directory.

To enable portable mode, you need to create a `portableMode.json` next to the Kando executable.
So for instance if you downloaded the Kando zip archive from GitHub and extracted it, you would create the file in the extracted folder.

```json title=portableMode.json
{
  // The path to the configuration directory.
  // This can be an absolute path or a path relative to this file.
  "configDirectory": "config"
}
```

The above example would make Kando load and save its configuration files in a subfolder named `config` next to the executable.
If you specified an absolute path instead, Kando would use that path.
This way, you can also use portable mode to load and save the configuration files in any other directory on your system.
