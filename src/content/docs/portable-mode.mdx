<Intro>
Kando can be configured to load and save all its [configuration files](/config-files) in its installation directory.
In fact, you can set any directory as Kando's configuration directory.

To enable portable mode, you need to create a `portableMode.json` next to the Kando executable.
So for instance if you downloaded the Kando zip archive from GitHub and extracted it, you would create the file in the extracted folder.

```json title=portableMode.json
{
  "configDirectory": "config"
}
```

The above example would make Kando load and save its configuration files in a subfolder named `config` next to the executable.
If you specified an absolute path (like `C:\path\to\something`) instead, Kando would use that path.
This way, you can also use portable mode to load and save the configuration files in any other directory on your system.

<Aside type="note" title="Cache Files">
  Even with portable mode enabled, Kando will still leave some traces on your system. Kando will store some cache files in the "normal" configuration directory (see [config files](/config-files)). However, these files are not critical and can be safely deleted if required.
