## <Icon name="solar:box-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via a Package Manager

<Steps>

1. Kando is available as a Homebrew Cask. You can install it by running:

   ```bash
   brew install kando
   ```

2. After the installation, you can start Kando from your launchpad! Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.

3. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the example menu! The only thing left to do is to grant the required permissions. See the [Grant Required Permissions](#required-permissions) section below for more information.

## Required Permissions

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
    Regardless of the installation method you chose, 
You will have to grant Kando **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions in the system settings.

Accessibility permissions are required to simulate key presses and move the mouse cursor. Screen Recording permissions are required to get the name of the currently focused window.
