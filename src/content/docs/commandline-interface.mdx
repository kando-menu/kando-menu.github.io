Kando comes with a command line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact with Kando from the terminal.
You learn [how to run Kando from the terminal](/launch-from-cli) in the advanced usage section.
For now, these commands are available:

<details>
<summary>`--menu "Menu Name"` or `-m "Menu Name"`</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>`--settings` or `-s`</summary>
