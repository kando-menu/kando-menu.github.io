HoweverYou can find sound themes in the [Kando Sound Themes Repository](https://github.com/kando-menu/sound-themes)!

### <Icon name="solar:cloud-download-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installing Sound Themes

A sound theme is a directory containing a `theme.json` and some audio files.
If you want to install such such a theme, you should put it into the `sound-themes` directory.
The location of this directory depends on your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```
    %appdata%\kando\sound-themes\
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/kando/sound-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```
    ~/.config/kando/sound-themes/
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### <Icon name="solar:headphones-square-sound-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Selecting a Sound Theme

For now, there is no graphical user interface to select a sound theme.
This will come in a future release.
However, you can easily change the sound theme by editing the `config.json` file.
This file is located in the same directory as the sound themes directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```
    %appdata%\kando\config.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/kando/config.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```
    ~/.config/kando/config.json
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Simply open this file with a text editor and change the `soundTheme` property to the name of the sound theme you want to use.
For example, if the directory of the sound theme you want to use is `my-sound-theme`, you use the following configuration:

```json5 title="config.json" {3-4}
{
  // ...
  "soundTheme": "my-sound-theme", // The name of the sound theme's directory
  "soundVolume": 0.5,
  // ...
}
```
