## <Icon name="solar:box-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Installation via a Package Manager

<Steps>

1. Kando is available as a Homebrew Cask. You can install it by running:

   ```bash
   brew install kando
   ```

2. After the installation, you can start Kando from your launchpad! Not much will happen, as Kando is a tray application and will run in the background.

3. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the example menu! The only thing left to do is to grant the required permissions. See the [Grant Required Permissions](#required-permissions) section below for more information.

## Required Permissions

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
    Regardless of the installation method you chose, 
You will have to grant Kando **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions in the system settings.
</Aside>

Accessibility permissions are required to simulate key presses and move the mouse cursor. Screen Recording permissions are required to get the name of the currently focused window.
