<Intro>
An URI item can not only be used to open a website but also to open any URI that your operating system can handle.
This includes opening files, directories, or even other applications.
</Intro>

## <Icon name="solar:globus-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Example URIs

Here are some examples of URIs that you can use with the Open-URI item:

- **http://example.com** - Opens the website `example.com` in your default browser.
- **file:///path/to/file.txt** - Opens the file `file.txt` in your default text editor.
- **mailto:foo@bar.com** - Opens your default email client to send an email.

## <Icon name="solar:code-line-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Placeholders

You can use placeholders in the URI which will be replaced by some actual values when the URI is opened.
This allows for some very advanced use-cases!
Below are the available placeholders:

- `{{app_name}}`: The name of the application which was focused when the menu was opened.
- `{{window_name}}`: The title of the window which was focused when the menu was opened.
- `{{pointer_x}}`: The x-coordinate of the mouse pointer when the menu was opened.
- `{{pointer_y}}`: The y-coordinate of the mouse pointer when the menu was opened.

## <Icon name="solar:settings-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Example Configuration

If you happen to edit your `menus.json` file by hand, you can create an Open-URI item with something like the following.
You can read more about the structure of the `menus.json` file in its [documentation](/config-files).

The `data` property of the menu item must contain a `uri` property which contains the URI to open.

```json title="menus.json"
// ...
{
  "name": "GitHub",
  "type": "uri",
  "icon": "github",
  "iconTheme": "simple-icons",
  "data": {
    "uri": "https://github.com"
  }
},
// ...
```
