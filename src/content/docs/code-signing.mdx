<Intro>
Since version 2.2.0, Windows and macOS installers of Kando are code-signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
</Intro>

<CustomAside type="thanks" title="Thank you!">
A huge thanks to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) for providing the code signing infrastructure and to the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) for providing a free code signing certificate for the Windows installers!
</CustomAside>

## Code Signing Process

Every code contribution to Kando is verified via GitHub's code review and branch protection mechanisms.
Only members of the [Kando's Code Review Team](https://github.com/orgs/kando-menu/teams/code-reviewers) are allowed to approve pull requests and merge them into the `main` branch.

When a new version of Kando is released, two code signing requests are automatically created on SignPath.io: One for the x64 Windows installer and one for the ARM64 Windows installer.
Currently, only [@Schneegans](https://github.com/orgs/kando-menu/people/Schneegans) is authorized to approve code signing requests for Kando.

## Privacy Policy

Kando will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it
