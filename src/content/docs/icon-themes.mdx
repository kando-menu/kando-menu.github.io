Kando comes with a few icon themes pre-installed.
To add your own icons to Kando, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Create a new `icon-themes` directory in Kando's configuration directory if it does not yet exist. Depending on your OS, this will be the following locations:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
        ```cmd
        %appdata%\kando\icon-themes
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
        ```bash
        ~/Library/Application Support/kando/icon-themes
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
        ```bash
        ~/.config/kando/icon-themes
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
        ```
        ~/.var/app/menu.kando.Kando/config/kando/icon-themes/
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Create another directory for your icon theme inside the `icon-themes` directory. You can give it any name you like.

3. Add your icons to the new directory. The icons can be in various formats, but we recommend using SVG files.

    <Aside type="tip">
      You can organize your icons in subdirectories. Kando will load them recursively.
    </Aside>


4. **Restart Kando.** Icon themes are only loaded when Kando starts.

5. Select your icon theme in the icon-theme dropdown in the icon picker in Kando's menu editor.

</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">
Kando will also load icon themes from `resources/app/.webpack/renderer/assets/icon-themes/` in the installation directory. This can be interesting if you are packaging icon themes using a package manager. However, as an end user, you should not put your icon themes there, as they might be overwritten during an update.

### Suggestions for Icon Sets

There are many great icon sets available on the internet. Here are some which you could try:
* [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle): Just use the files from the `Numix-Circle/48/apps` directory.
* [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme): Here you could use the content from the `Papirus/64x64` directory.
* [Tela](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme): Here you find the icons in the `src/scalable` directory.
