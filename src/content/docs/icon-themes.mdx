Kando comes with a few icon themes pre-installed and you can easily add your own.
</Intro>

Kando comes with a few icon themes pre-installed. You can select them in the icon picker in the menu editor.

1. [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) (Plain & Colored): A set of icons for popular brands.
2. [Material Symbols Rounded](https://fonts.google.com/icons): An icon set for common actions and objects.
3. Emojis: This allows you to use any emoji as an icon.
4. Kando's own icons: Kando comes with a few icons which are used per default for new menu items.

To add your own icons to Kando, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Create a directory for your icon theme inside the `icon-themes` directory. You can give it any name you like. Where this directory is located depends on your operating system:

    <Tabs syncKey="os">
      <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
        ```cmd
        %appdata%\kando\
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
        ```bash
        ~/Library/Application Support/kando/
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
        ```bash
        ~/.config/kando/
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
        ```
        ~/.var/app/menu.kando.Kando/config/kando/
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <FileTree>
    - kando
      - icon-themes/ Put your theme folder in here.
        - some-icon-theme/ The name will be shown in the icon picker.
          - icon1.svg
          - icon2.svg
          - ...
      - menu-themes/ 
      - sound-themes/ 
      - config.json
      - menus.json
    </FileTree>

2. Add your icons to the new directory. The icons can be in various formats, but we recommend using SVG files.

    <Aside type="tip">
      You can organize your icons in subdirectories. Kando will load them recursively.
    </Aside>

3. **Restart Kando.** Icon themes are only loaded when Kando starts.

4. Select your icon theme in the icon-theme dropdown in the icon picker in Kando's menu editor.
