<Intro>
  While Kando does not have a builtin way to open menus with mouse buttons or touch
  gestures, there are many platform-dependent third-party tools which can help you with
  this.
</Intro>

## Open Menus From Other Tools

You can either make the third-party tool open the menu by simulating the shortcut for the menu, or it can directly call the Kando executable with the [`--menu "menu name"`](/launch-from-cli) or [`--trigger <shortcut>`](/launch-from-cli) argument.

### Option 1: Simulate the Shortcut

If the third-party tool supports simulating keyboard shortcuts, it is recommended to use this method.
In most cases, this will be a bit faster then option 2.

You can choose any shortcut you like!
Using one which does not interfere with you workflow is a good idea.
For instance <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F13</kbd> is usually not used by any application, so it is a good choice.

<Aside type="tip" title="Use a modifier key!">
  Kando menus can be called with single-key shortcuts, but this is not recommended. Turbo
  mode will only work properly if the shortcut includes a modifier like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>,{' '}
  <kbd>Alt</kbd>, or <kbd>Shift</kbd>.
</Aside>

### Option 2: Use `--menu` or `--trigger`

With the `--menu` and `--trigger` arguments, you can open a Kando menu by calling the Kando executable with the name or shortcut of the menu you want to open.
Depending on your operating system, the command to open a Kando menu would look like this:

<Tabs syncKey='os'>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```cmd
    %localappdata%\Kando\app-<version number>\Kando.exe --menu "Example Menu"
    %localappdata%\Kando\app-<version number>\Kando.exe --trigger Control+Space
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```bash
    /Applications/Kando.app/Contents/MacOS/Kando --menu "Example Menu"
    /Applications/Kando.app/Contents/MacOS/Kando --trigger Control+Space
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```bash
    /usr/bin/kando --menu "Example Menu"
    /usr/bin/kando --trigger Control+Space
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
    ```bash
    flatpak run menu.kando.Kando --menu "Example Menu"
    flatpak run menu.kando.Kando --trigger Control+Space
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Third-Party Tools for Opening Menus

Many mice come with special drivers which allow you to rebind mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts or to run arbitrary commands.
If your mouse supports this, this is an easy way to

If you do not have such a driver, you can use any of the third-party tools listed below.
Most of them are free and open-source.

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    * [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a powerful scripting language for
    Windows. You can use it to run the kando command when you press a mouse button or to
    remap a mouse button to a keyboard shortcut which opens a Kando menu. You can follow
    [this guide](https://github.com/orgs/kando-menu/discussions/853) for a complete
    example. *
    [GestureSign](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N45WQVK2QQW?ocid=pdpshare)
    allows opening a Kando menu with multi-touch taps and gestures on both touchpad and
    touchscreen.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    * [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) can be used to remap
    mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts. * [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) allows
    opening a Kando menu via touchpad gestures. * [Multitouch](https://multitouch.app)
    allows to add keyboard shortcut as a gesture for trackpad or Apple Magic Mouse. *
    [BetterMouse](https://better-mouse.com/) is a tool which allows you to remap mouse
    buttons to keyboard shortcuts.

  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    * [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) together with it's [sendkey
    plugin](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-sendkey?tab=readme-ov-file) can be
    used to open a Kando menu with touchpad or touchscreen gestures. It works on **X11**
    and **Wayland**. * [Input Remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper) is a
    tool which allows you to remap mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts. It works both on
    **X11 and Wayland**. While you can use it directly to bind menus to mouse buttons via
    keyboard shortcuts, it also allows for more advanced setups like showing menus when
    pressing two mouse buttons at the same time. [Here is a
    guide!](https://github.com/orgs/kando-menu/discussions/1183) *
    [Touchegg](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg#readme) is a multitouch gesture
    recognizer for Linux. You can use it to open a Kando menu with touchpad gestures. It
    only works on **X11**. * **KDE Plasma** comes with built-in support for remapping
    mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts. You can find [this
    feature](https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-Rebind-Extra-Mouse-Buttons) in the system
    settings under "System Settings" / "Mouse & Touchpad" / "Add Binding". * There's a
    [Configurable Button](https://store.kde.org/p/1297839/) widget for **KDE Plasma**
    which allows running `kando --menu "menu name"` when clicked. * On **GNOME Shell**,
    you can use the [CHC-E (Custom Hot Corners -
    Extended)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4167/custom-hot-corners-extended/)
    extension to run arbitrary commands when you move your mouse to a corner of the
    screen. * On **GNOME Shell**, you can also use the [Floating
    Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2542/floating-dock/). It requires a bit
    of tinkering as you need to create custom desktop files for each menu you want to
    open. However, it allows you to open menus by clicking on a floating dock icon.
