<Intro>
While Kando does not have a cross-platform way to open menus with a mouse button, there are many platform-dependent third-party tools which can help you with this.
</Intro>

With some creativity, you can open menus not only with mouse buttons but also with gestures, desktop widgets, or in many other ways.

## Open Menus from Third-Party Tools

You can either make the third-party tool open the menu by simulation the shortcut for the menu, or it can directly call the Kando executable with the `--menu "menu name"` argument.

Depending on your operating system, the command to open a Kando menu would look like this:

<Tabs syncKey='os'>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```cmd
    %localappdata%\Kando\app-<version number>\Kando.exe --menu "Menu Name"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
    ```bash
    /Applications/Kando.app/Contents/MacOS/Kando --menu "Menu Name"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```bash
    /usr/bin/kando --menu "Menu Name"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Flatpak" icon="linux">
    ```bash
    flatpak run menu.kando.Kando --menu "Menu Name"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip" title="Simulate the shortcut if possible!">
If the third-party tool supports simulating keyboard shortcuts, it is recommended to use this method.
Opening a menu by calling the Kando executable will usually be a bit slower than simulating the shortcut.

## Third-Party Tools

Below are some applications which can help you to open menus in various ways.
Most of them are free and open-source.

<Tabs syncKey='os'>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
   * [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a powerful scripting language for Windows. You can use it to run the kando command when you press a mouse button or to remap a mouse button to a keyboard shortcut which opens a Kando menu.
   * [GestureSign](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N45WQVK2QQW?ocid=pdpshare) allows opening a Kando menu with multi-touch taps and gestures on both touchpad and touchscreen.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">
   * [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) can be used to remap mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts.
   * [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) allows opening a Kando menu via touchpad gestures.
   * [Multitouch](https://multitouch.app) allows to add keyboard shortcut as a gesture for trackpad or Apple Magic Mouse.
   * [BetterMouse](https://better-mouse.com/) is a tool which allows you to remap mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
   * [Input Remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper) is a tool which allows you to remap mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts. It works both on **X11 and Wayland**.
   * [Touchegg](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg#readme) is a multitouch gesture recognizer for Linux. You can use it to open a Kando menu with touchpad gestures. It only works on **X11**.
   * **KDE Plasma** comes with built-in support for remapping mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts. You can find [this feature](https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-Rebind-Extra-Mouse-Buttons) in the system settings under "System Settings" / "Mouse & Touchpad" / "Add Binding".
   * There's a [Configurable Button](https://store.kde.org/p/1297839/) widget for **KDE Plasma** which allows running `kando --menu "menu name"` when clicked.
   * On **GNOME**, you can use the [CHC-E (Custom Hot Corners - Extended)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4167/custom-hot-corners-extended/) extension to run arbitrary commands when you move your mouse to a corner of the screen.
   * On **GNOME**, you can also use the [Floating Dock)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2542/floating-dock/). It requires a bit of tinkering as you need to create custom desktop files for each menu you want to open. However, it allows you to open menus by clicking on a floating dock icon.
