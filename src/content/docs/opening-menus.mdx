<Intro>
  While Kando does not have a builtin way to open menus with 🖱️ mouse buttons or 👆 touch
  gestures, there are many platform-dependent third-party tools which can help you with
  this!

## More Third-Party Tools

We do not have specific guides for these tools yet, but they should work with Kando as well.
Feel free to experiment with them and share your findings with us!

   * [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) together with it's [sendkey plugin](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-sendkey?tab=readme-ov-file) can be used to open a Kando menu with touchpad or touchscreen gestures. It works on **X11** and **Wayland**.
   * [Touchegg](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg#readme) is a multitouch gesture recognizer for Linux. You can use it to open a Kando menu with touchpad gestures. It only works on **X11**.
   * **KDE Plasma** comes with built-in support for remapping mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts. You can find [this feature](https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-Rebind-Extra-Mouse-Buttons) in the system settings under "System Settings" / "Mouse & Touchpad" / "Add Binding".
   * There's a [Configurable Button](https://store.kde.org/p/1297839/) widget for **KDE Plasma** which allows running `kando --menu "menu name"` when clicked.
   * On **GNOME Shell**, you can use the [CHC-E (Custom Hot Corners - Extended)](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4167/custom-hot-corners-extended/) extension to run arbitrary commands when you move your mouse to a corner of the screen.
   * On **GNOME Shell**, you can also use the [Floating Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2542/floating-dock/). It requires a bit of tinkering as you need to create custom desktop files for each menu you want to open. However, it allows you to open menus by clicking on a floating dock icon.

Fundamentally, there are two main ways to open Kando menus from these tools.
You can either open a menu by simulating the shortcut for the menu (if this is supported by the tool), or you can make the tool call the Kando executable with the [`--menu "menu name"`](/launch-from-cli) or [`--trigger <shortcut>`](/launch-from-cli) argument.

### Option 1: Simulate the Shortcut

If the third-party tool supports simulating keyboard shortcuts, it is recommended to use this method.
In most cases, this will be a bit faster then option 2.

Many mice even come with special drivers which allow you to rebind mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts or to run arbitrary commands.
If your mouse supports this, this is an easy way to open Kando menus with mouse buttons.

You can choose any shortcut you like!
Using one which does not interfere with you workflow is a good idea.
For instance <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F13</kbd> is usually not used by any application, so it is a good choice.

### Option 2: Use `--menu` or `--trigger`

With the `--menu` and `--trigger` arguments, you can open a Kando menu by calling the Kando executable with the name or shortcut of the menu you want to open.
Depending on your operating system, the command to open a Kando menu would look like this:

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```cmd
    %localappdata%\Kando\app-<version number>\Kando.exe --menu "Example Menu"
